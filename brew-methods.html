        <h2 class="container-title">Coffee Brewing Methods</h2>
        <div class="container-content">
            <p>A visit to the coffee shop can tell you everything you need to know about how many variants of coffee and brew methods exists. With so many different brews, beans, and types, it can be daunting. Coffee has come a long way in the past few years, with brewing methods constantly evolving and shifting as baristas and connoisseurs search for the perfect cup. In this guide, we will look into the most commonly consumed types of coffee drinks now available to professional and home baristas.</p>

            <h3>Drip/Batch Coffee</h3>
            <div class="brew-description">
                <img src="assets/images/drip_coffee.jpg" alt="Drip Coffee" class="brew-image">
                <p>Drip coffee is one of the most popular coffee brewing methods. Drip coffee machines relies on thermally induced pressure to send water up to the shower head, and gravity to pull it down through the coffee grounds. It dissolves considerably less of the coffee’s soluble mass, and the paper filters or metal mesh common to this brew method will trap many of the oils that would otherwise be present in espresso, french press, or percolator coffee. The coffee from a drip brewer is clear and clean, with a high ratio of caffeine extracted per spoon of ground coffee. Brewing in this simple method can produce coffee at mass, and thus, incredibly common in many homes.</p>                 
            </div>

            <hr class="container-hr">
                
            <h3>French Press</h3>
            <div class="brew-description">
                <img src="assets/images/french_press.jpg" alt="French Press" class="brew-image">
                <p>French press, is a very simple coffee brewing device with a beaker and a plunger/filter. The technique consists of pouring hot water over course coffee grinds and let it steep for a few minutes. After the steeping is over the plunger is pressed down, to separate the grinds. French press is an immersion method which is a great first step into making good coffee at home.</p> 
                <p>French press provides a bold flavour with a heavy body, so coffees with a medium to dark roast, with chocolate or nutty flavour notes, would work well. The coffee needs to be ground coarsely for brewing with french press, similar to the size of rock salt.</p>

            <h3>Moka Pot</h3>
            <div class="brew-description">
                <img src="assets/images/moka_pot.jpg" alt="Moka Pot" class="brew-image">
                <p>Moka pot is a tiny, Italian-made, eight-sided device for making coffee that uses steam pressure to push water through coffee grinds similar to espresso method, but with much lower pressure. Invented in 1933 by Alfonso Bialetti, the affordable aluminium Moka Express was meant to mimic espresso-quality coffee at home. The pressure in a moka pot is about 1 bar compared to a real espresso machine with 9 bar.</p>
                <p>The coffee made in a Moka pot, is very bold, it produces an intense hit of caffeine. This stovetop espresso lacks the crema, and it has much less aromatic oils.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Aeropress</h3>
            <div class="brew-description">
                <img src="assets/images/aeropress.jpg" alt="Aeropress" class="brew-image">
                <p>A relatively recent addition the aeropress is a manual coffee making device that allows you to use pressure to brew a cup. The method involves loading the bottom cylinder with a paper or metal filter, with ground coffee, and slowly add the desired amount of hot water. Mix the grounds and the water and allow to steep followed by inserting the top cylinder with the rubber stopper down. Then, slowly press the top cylinder down to create a vacuum that pushes the brew through the coffee grounds and filter under pressure to extract even more solids and caffeine.</p>
                <p>Aeropress coffee is strong with ample body and resembles a lot with espresso. Aeropress is a great manual device that combines the functionality of a french press with the control of a pour over dripper, but the drawback is that it only makes a single cup of coffee.</p>

            <h3>Hario V60</h3>
            <div class="brew-description">
                <img src="assets/images/hario_v60.jpg" alt="Hario V60" class="brew-image">
                <p>The Hario V60 is a conical pour-over brewer design made in Japan that can be plastic, metal or ceramic. The name V60 derives from the dripper's design, the cone is V shaped and has a 60° angle. It has exploded in popularity in the past few years because they provide users with a great balance of convenience that brings out the cleanest flavor from your coffee and control over each cup. The Hario dripper is a simple brew method that has little setup and cleanup, place a disposable filter in the dripper, add coffee, and pour hot (but not boiling water) over the grinds. The coffee will filter right down into your cup or server. The drawback of this method is that it requires a practiced hand that only makes a single cup. However the slow method of pour over brewing can bring out the subtle and complex flavours of the coffee.</p>

            <h3>Chemex</h3>
            <div class="brew-description">   
                <img src="assets/images/chemex.jpg" alt="Chemex" class="brew-image">
                <p>The chemex is a beautifully designed pour-over brewer, with an hourglass shape made from glass, a wooden neck and a leather tie that looks both contemporary and timeless. The chemex brewer is more expensive than the Hario V60 but balances the taste of pour over coffee with the ability to brew a large batch. The chemex is one of the older brewing methods that was created by German inventor Peter Schlumbohm in 1941 and manufactured by the Chemex Corporation. </p>
                <p>The chemex is fairly simple brew method, place the filter into the carafe, add your grounds, and then slowly pour over the water, using spiral motions just like with the Hario V60. The filters used are a lot thicker than others, and produce a less bitter and acidic brew. The only problem is that you need to buy Chemex brand filters, which are more expensive than other filters. Brewing with the chemex produces a deep, rich coffee with good flavor complexity, if not the bright, clear highlights for which the Hario is favored. They both produce quality results, with the Chemex favoring richness while the Hario yields clarity.</p>

            <h3>Espresso</h3>
            <div class="brew-description">
                <p>Espresso is a method to brew coffee, which originated in Italy, using an espresso machine that pushes hot water through a compact ‘puck’ of finely ground coffee at high pressure, usually at around 9 bar. Espresso coffee can be made with any variety of coffee beans and roasts, though some types taste better than others. Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, has a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and has crema on top (a foam with a creamy consistency). The crema adds to the rich flavour and lingering aftertaste of espresso.</p>
                <p>Espresso is a concentrated form of coffee served in small, strong shots usually 1 or 2oz and is the base for a number of coffee drinks. Espresso based drinks generally share three common ingredients, espresso, steamed milk and micro-foam.</p>
